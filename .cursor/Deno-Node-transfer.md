# Deno to Node.js Conversion Checklist

## Overarching Guidelines

- **Version Control:**
  - Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes throughout the conversion process.
  - Create a separate branch for the conversion to avoid disrupting the main codebase.

- **Code Consistency:**
  - Maintain consistent coding standards and style throughout the project.
  - Use a linter and formatter to enforce code quality.

- **Documentation:**
  - Keep documentation up-to-date with any changes made during the conversion.
  - Document any new dependencies or tools introduced.

- **Testing:**
  - Implement automated testing to ensure code reliability and catch issues early.
  - Use continuous integration (CI) to automate testing and deployment processes.

- **Collaboration:**
  - Communicate regularly with team members about progress and challenges.
  - Encourage code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge.

- **Backup and Recovery:**
  - Regularly back up the codebase to prevent data loss.
  - Have a recovery plan in place in case of critical issues.

## Conversion Steps

- [x] Identify Deno-specific code
- [ ] Replace URL imports with Node.js package imports
- [ ] Replace Deno's `serve` function with a Node.js HTTP server
- [ ] Update environment variable handling to use `process.env`
- [ ] Replace Deno's file system and other APIs with Node.js equivalents
- [ ] Write tests to validate functionality
- [ ] Update deployment configuration for Node.js
- [ ] Update documentation and comments
- [ ] Conduct iterative testing and gather feedback
- [ ] Deploy the Node.js version to production
